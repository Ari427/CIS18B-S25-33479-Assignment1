Assignment 1

To use the Simple Bank System application, open the project folder in Visual Studio Code. In VS Code, open the file named "SimpleBankSystem.java". Once the file has been opened, you can click the "Run" button at the top of the editor. Now you will just interact with the program in the terminal, where you can create accounts, deposit or withdraw money, and check balances. I hope you enjoy the Simple Bank System application.
